            School shuttles are mainly meant for students, therefore please give
            priority to them. However, since some school shuttles do run in
            great lengths (like 121E), it may be possible that the driver will
            allow other passengers. If that is the case, please respect the
            driver's judgment.

            Please do NOT inquire the STM regarding the data presented in the

        >Q: Maps outside Montreal are not loading for me? / Why am I not subject
        to OpenStreetMap's privacy policy?</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      A: All the map tiles (images) are proxied through the backend, meaning the
      web server will access OpenStreetMap on your behalf. Your data (Like IP
      addresses, browser, etc.) are NOT provided to them, meaning you're not
      subject to their privacy policy (Hooray for privacy!). However, to prevent
      overuse, maps outside Montreal (as defined by me) will not be loaded.

    <p>
      <b>Q: Any future plans?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      A: I plan to add more schools by experimenting with data (After all, very
      few schools publicize the schedule). Should there be a demand, I might add
      a simple email notification system.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Q: Is there a static GTFS trips.txt for these school buses?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      A: It's a work in progress.
