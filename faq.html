      <b>Q: Why emojis and pictograms for the bus info?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      A: It's better than <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/569686028558925828/688173363205636106/Screen_Shot_2020-03-10_at_08.png">reading two blobs of words (before 0.0.4)</a>. <del>Also that means I have less strings to translate to French to accommodate the Loi 101.</del>

      <b>Q: Any future plans?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      A: I plan to add more schools by experimenting with data (After all, very few schools publicize the schedule). Should there be a demand, I might add a simple email notification system.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Q: Is there a static GTFS trips.txt for these school buses?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      A: It's a work in progress.
