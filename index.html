  <p>Track shuttle buses from the following schools:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/marianopolis">Marianopolis</a> (Includes direction & stop interpreter)</li>
    <li><a href="/andre-laurendeau">Andr√©-Laurendeau</a> (Just raw data at this moment)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Notes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>This tracker pings the STM API every <b>45</b> seconds.</li>
    <li>This tracker <b>will NOT update</b> between 8:00pm and 7:00am. This is necessary to respect the API ratelimits imposed by the STM.</li>
    <li>Trip IDs <b>may be guessed.</b> If there is any inaccuracies regarding the direction of a bus ("It's going to the metro station but tracker says it's going to the school???"), <a href="https://austinhuang.me/contact">report them to me.</a></li>
    <li>I'm responsible enough to list <i>all</i> the third-party privacy policies that you <i>could</i> be subjected at the bottom of every page. You think I'm gonna track you down while I'm still struggling with R-score??? (No, seriously, <a href="https://glitch.com/~maribus-test">read the source code.</a>)</li>
